##Code Review Workflow (GitHub Flow)
- Contributing is easy. Mathbeast administrators can create a feature branch off the current
development branch (i.e. mvp4) and create a pull request the feature (or bug fix) is complete.
- Non administrators can fork Mathbeast to work on a feature or bug fix. Once said feature or
bug fix is complete, submit a pull request on GitHub.com.

##Set Up Development Environment
You won't need an http server, but you'll need to compile Less files into CSS.
